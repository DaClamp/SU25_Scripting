Create pseudocode for a number guessing game
--------------------------------------------
WHILE user wants to play DO
    SET secret_number TO a random number between 1 and 100
    SET max_attempts TO 7
    SET attempts TO 0
    SET has_won TO false

    PRINT "Guess the number between 1 and 100. You have 7 attempts."

    WHILE attempts < max_attempts DO
        PROMPT user to enter a guess
        INCREMENT attempts by 1

        IF guess equals secret_number THEN
            PRINT "Congratulations! You guessed the number in [attempts] attempts."
            SET has_won TO true
            BREAK out of the loop
        ELSE IF guess < secret_number THEN
            PRINT "Too low. Try again."
        ELSE
            PRINT "Too high. Try again."

    END WHILE

    IF has_won is false THEN
        PRINT "Sorry, you lost. The correct number was [secret_number]."

    PROMPT user "Do you want to play again? (yes/no)"
    IF user input is not "yes" THEN
        EXIT the main game loop

END WHILE

PRINT "Thanks for playing!"
