Create pseudocode for a number guessing game
--------------------------------------------

variable: randNum = none
variable: userGuess = none
variable: numOfGuesses = 7
variable: replay = Y

*Set up random generator
randNum = random number between 1 and 100 *look at inclusive/exclusive ends
1. Do
	Do
		1. Print out: "Guess a number 1 to 100: "
		2. While userGuess is NONE, EMPTY, or NOT A NUMBER, keep asking
			Once valid, store user input into userGuess and add 1 to numOfGuesses
			1. If userGuess = randNum: Print out: "Congratulations, the number was (randNum)!"
			2. Else If userGuess > randNum:
				numOfGuesses -= 1
				Print out: "Too high, (numOfGuesses) guesses left!"
			3. Else If userGuess < randNum:
				numOfGuesses -= 1
				Print out: "Too low, (numOfGuesses) guesses left!"
	While userGuess is NOT EQUAL to randNum
	1. Print out: "Would you like to play again? y/n: "
	2. If input is NOT 'y' OR 'n': Print out: "Invalid, please try again"
	3. Else: replay = input
While replay is NOT n
2. Print out: "Goodbye"
